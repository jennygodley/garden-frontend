### About

Garden Party is a garden planning app. You can create garden plots and select from pre-populated flowers to fill your garden. You can then see a month-by-month view to ensure your garden is in bloom across the seasons.

Flower data was collated by me and added to the database. It can be read by the user but not updated. A reference to selected flowers is stored in the garden plot resource.

Flower data is based on gardens in Eastern Massachusetts. Please note that bloom and planting times may be different in different parts of the country.

### Technologies

* Axios
* HTML
* Sass
* React Bootstrap

### Process

I planned phases for this project, with the expectation that I wouldn't be able to finish everything inside the four days of project time. I wanted to be able to display and extract information for the gardener to plan their garden. Ultimately, I decided that planning a blooming garden is the most important aspect of the app.
I found working with the pre-defined plant and the reference to it in garden plot to be challenging. I spent a lot of time trying to get the toggles working properly when users edit the plants in their garden.

### Wireframes and User Stories

### Unsolved problems

I'd like to integrate with external APIs to get the weather, and to show pictures of the flowers in the database.
I'd like to improve the visualization of the calendar as well.

### Set up and Installation
